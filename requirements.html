                          >Soy milk, a nutritious beverage, is made by
                          extracting a milky liquid from ground, cooked
                          soybeans. This creamy white liquid, similar in
                          appearance to cow's milk, offers a rich source of
                          protein and iron. Unlike dairy milk, soy milk is
                          cholesterol-free, low in fat, and low in sodium. While
                          it may lack calcium naturally, it can be fortified for
                          those needing additional calcium intake, especially
                          growing children. Soy milk is a suitable alternative
                          for individuals allergic to cow's milk or those with
                          lactose intolerance, as it is free of lactose, the
                          natural sugar found in dairy milk.</span

                          >here's a step-by-step guide to making soy milk at
                          home: Soak Soybeans: Begin by soaking 1 cup of dried
                          soybeans in water overnight or for at least 8 hours.
                          Use enough water to cover the soybeans by a few
                          inches. Drain and Rinse: After soaking, drain and
                          rinse the soybeans thoroughly under cold water. Blend
                          with Water: In a blender, combine the soaked soybeans
                          with 3-4 cups of fresh water. The exact amount of
                          water depends on how thick or thin you want your soy
                          milk to be. Start with 3 cups and adjust as needed.
                          Blend Until Smooth: Blend the soybeans and water on
                          high speed for about 2-3 minutes, or until you have a
                          smooth mixture. Strain: Place a fine mesh strainer or
                          cheesecloth over a large bowl or pitcher. Pour the
                          blended mixture through the strainer, allowing the
                          liquid to separate from the solids. You may need to do
                          this in batches depending on the size of your
                          strainer. Press to Extract Liquid: Press down on the
                          solids with a spoon or spatula to extract as much
                          liquid (soy milk) as possible. Sweeten and Flavor
                          (Optional): If desired, sweeten the soy milk with
                          sugar, honey, or another sweetener to taste. You can
                          also add flavorings such as vanilla extract or cocoa
                          powder for additional flavor. Refrigerate: Transfer
                          the strained soy milk to a clean container and
                          refrigerate. It will keep for about 3-4 days. Enjoy:
                          Use your homemade soy milk in recipes, smoothies, or
                          as a dairy-free alternative in coffee or tea. That's
                          it! You've successfully made soy milk at home. Adjust
                          the quantities of ingredients according to your
                          preferences and enjoy the nutritious and delicious
                          beverage.</span

                          >here's a detailed breakdown of the average
                          nutritional information for soy milk per 240ml (1 cup)
                          serving: Calories: Approximately 80-110 calories,
                          depending on whether it's sweetened or unsweetened.
                          Protein: About 7-9 grams, making it a good source of
                          plant-based protein. Fat: Typically 4-5 grams, mostly
                          unsaturated fats, which are heart-healthy.
                          Carbohydrates: Around 4-5 grams, primarily from
                          naturally occurring sugars in soybeans. Fiber:
                          Approximately 1-2 grams, providing a small but
                          beneficial amount of dietary fiber. Calcium: Fortified
                          soy milk provides about 200-300 milligrams of calcium,
                          similar to cow's milk. However, the exact amount can
                          vary depending on the brand and fortification level.
                          Vitamin D: Fortified soy milk often contains vitamin
                          D, ranging from 100 to 300 IU (International Units)
                          per serving. This vitamin is crucial for bone health
                          and immune function. Vitamin B12: Some brands of soy
                          milk are fortified with vitamin B12, which is
                          important for nerve function and red blood cell
                          production, especially for those following a vegan or
                          vegetarian diet. Iron: Soy milk contains about 1-2
                          milligrams of iron per serving, but this can vary
                          depending on fortification. Iron is essential for
                          oxygen transport in the blood and overall energy
                          levels. Potassium: Approximately 300-350 milligrams,
                          contributing to healthy blood pressure and muscle
                          function. Phosphorus: Around 100-150 milligrams,
                          aiding in bone health and energy metabolism.
                          Magnesium: Typically 20-30 milligrams, supporting
                          muscle and nerve function, as well as bone health.
                          Riboflavin (Vitamin B2): Soy milk contains around
                          0.2-0.3 milligrams, helping with energy production and
                          metabolism. Niacin (Vitamin B3): About 0.5-1
                          milligram, supporting overall cellular function and
                          metabolism. Folate (Vitamin B9): Approximately 15-20
                          micrograms, crucial for cell division and DNA
                          synthesis. Phytochemicals: Soy milk contains
                          phytochemicals such as isoflavones, which have
                          antioxidant properties and may offer various health
                          benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease and
                          certain cancers. Keep in mind that these values are
                          approximate and can vary based on factors such as
                          brand, fortification, and specific ingredients used.
                          Always check the nutrition label on the product for
                          the most accurate information.</span
